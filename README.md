# ETL Scripts 

I find myself dealing with a lot of data in various raw forms. I am slowly gathering all these scripts, cleaning them up and storing in this repos. Bits and pieces of each may be helpful. Many random python packages are used as well, which one may find useful when trying to extract data from a particular source.
